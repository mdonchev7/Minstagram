# Minstagram
Consumes Kinvey's backend services through their iOS API, uses multithreading programming, autolayout, does some basic image manipulations, uses a swift third party library in order to access the camera and the photo library. Image caching (using Core Data), some bug fixes, some UI improvements and code refactoring are yet on my todo list.
